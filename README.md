# 🎓 Capstone Project

## ✨ Project Overview

This project appears to be a **Capstone Project** developed as a web application following a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern. A unique and significant aspect of this project is its integration with a **hardware component**, suggesting a system that combines software control with physical interaction or data acquisition. It likely aims to solve a real-world problem by providing a user interface for controlling or monitoring a hardware system.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

The following technologies are identified or inferred based on the project's file structure:

* **Backend:**
    * **PHP:** Utilized for server-side scripting, handling logic, database interactions, and API endpoints (e.g., `endpoint.php`).
        !
* **Frontend:**
    * **HTML:** For structuring the web content.
    * **CSS:** For styling the user interface.
    * **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and dynamic content on the client-side.
        !
* **Database (Inferred):**
    * **MySQL / MariaDB:** Commonly used with PHP applications for data storage and retrieval.
        !
* **Hardware Integration:**
    * **Embedded Programming / Microcontroller Platform:** (Specific technology like Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, etc., would be defined in the `capstone_hardware` folder's contents, but is not specified here).
