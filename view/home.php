        <p class="step-text">To begin using the B.A.S.U.R.A. system, the user approaches the machine, which is placed in a common community areaâ€”preferably near the covered gym for better security and accessibility. The system is designed to handle three types of waste: plastic bottles, glass bottles, and metal cans. As the user deposits an item into the input slot, the system activates its capacitive proximity sensors. These sensors detect the material by measuring its dielectric properties, allowing the system to identify whether the item is plastic, glass, or metal.</p>

    <div class="step reverse">

        <p class="step-text">Once identified, the waste item is automatically sorted using servo motors that guide it into the appropriate bin based on its classification. This sorting mechanism reduces the need for manual segregation and ensures cleaner, properly categorized recyclables for scrap dealers and junkshops. Each deposited item is recorded in the system's database, along with the user's contribution. This real-time tracking allows the system to monitor the volume and type of waste being collected per user.</p>

    <div class="step">
        <img src="images/step3.png" class="steps">
        <p class="step-text">To encourage continued participation, users can access a web application linked to the system. Through this web app, they can view their accumulated points, see their contribution stats, and learn how to use the machine properly through a built-in user guide. The reward system is based on the quantity and type of waste contributed, and users can redeem goods once they reach a certain point threshold. This setup not only promotes proper waste disposal and segregation but also engages the community in a fun and rewarding way.</p>
